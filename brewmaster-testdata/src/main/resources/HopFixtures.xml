                Cascade hops contains moderate alpha acid content ranging from 4.5% to 7%. Its real strength is in the aroma, as it was the premier aroma hop developed in the U.S. This mettlesome grower bears a verdant, botanic bouquet. It carries some spicyness to it as well. The aroma of Cascade also comes with citrus, sometimes compared to grapefruit. This no doubt comes from the higher levels of myrcene. Farnesene also registers fairly high in Cascade, which is used in the perfume and food industry.

                Centennial Hops was first created in 1974 and boasts an alpha acid rating of 9.5%-11.5%. It is sometimes referred to as a Super Cascade, however it is lighter on the citrus aromas. Centennial works undoubtedly well in Pale Ales and India Pale Ales, where some bottomline bitterness is needed with the top end aroma. The floral flavor and aroma of this variety is evident in many commercial beers.

                Hallertaur Magnum, or Magnum, is commonly used as a base bittering hops in many recipes. It provides the bitter foundation from which to build upon. Hallertauer Magnum has a somewhat unnoticeable aroma. And although this lack of character which gives so many other varieties their luster, it comes as an asset for this variety as it offers the brewer a different type of tool for the pot. Hallertauer Magnum has high an alpha acid rating of 12.0%-14.0%. And although the essential oils are very present, and the total oil within the cones is on the high side, the overall combination along with the genetics downplay their overall influence. These characteristics combined, make Hallertauer Magnum extremely appropriate for early boil additions.
